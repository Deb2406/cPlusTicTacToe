[**TicTacToe**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.

What is this project for?

• This is my first pet project that I uploaded to a githab and I bothered with the design and comments.

• In historical perspective later look at your code and assess the progress of learning programming.
